            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>PREFACE</hi> to the Chriſtian <hi>READER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT may be expected that I ſhould (according to Cuſtom) ſay ſomething towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of the following Diſcourſe to the peruſal of the Reader; and tell him what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives I had to undertake this work. But the truth is, I have neither ſtudied, nor ever ſeen any great Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this kind of Courtſhip. I know, the Weight and Importance of the Subject; the Honeſty and Charitableneſs of the Deſign; the Truth and Evidence of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the Importunity of Friends, and the Authority of others whoſe Judgment we value above our own, are the common heads of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe in ſuch Caſes. If any or all of theſe will ſerve for an Apology, I
<pb facs="tcp:42069:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>hope I have ſome right to them; if they will not, it muſt undergo the Readers Cenſure. However I ſhall acquaint him with the Scope of the whole Treatiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> To make a Faithful Repreſentation of ſuch Principles and Deſigns as (under a colour of Religion) do naturally tend to diſturb the Publick Peace &amp; Settlement of this Church and Kingdom; ſubvert the true Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Religion &amp; Deſtroy Chriſtian Charity, by fomenting Inteſtine Commotions or Foreign <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And if there be ſuch a thing in the World (I am loath to call it Religion) as teaches men to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance it ſelf by Treaſon and Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, by Falſhood and Treachery, it is our Duty and Intereſt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the Fraud and Hypocriſy of it.</p>
            <p>In the treating of this Subject,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I have not only juſtified the Charge of Diſloyalty and Cruelty
<pb facs="tcp:42069:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>againſt the Court and church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but alſo examined and confuted the moſt plauſible Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Loyalty and Charity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Doctrines and Practiſes of ſome reputed Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants have given a deep Wound to the Reputation of our Religion; and ſome moſt horrid things have been taught and acted in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, out of a real or pretended zeal for the Proteſtant Cauſe; I have vindicated the Honour &amp; Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Reformation, and ſhewed from whence the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick Sectaries derived their Principles, by whom they were In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, and whom they gratified in that management of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have given a brief account of Comprehenſion and Toleration, ſo far as they fell within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of the late Lord <hi>Staffords</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:42069:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>Deſign; and I am ſenſible it would have been an Argument of weakneſs or arrogance in me to have entred upon a larger Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon thoſe Heads, ſo ſoon, after the late Propoſals of a great and learned Man for the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Diſſenters.<note n="(A)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Preface to the</hi> unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, (<hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted 1681.</hi>)</note>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, I have concluded with ſuch Important Conſiderations to all ſober Diſſenting Proteſtants (whom I diſtinguiſh from wild Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks) as I believe are neceſſary for the keeping out of Popery.</p>
            <p>In the Proſecution of the whole Argument, I have neither made any uncharitable Reflections, nor charged any perſons with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Conſequences of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. And (though I will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all little Miſtakes or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencies in the Writing or Printing) I have neither taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Quotations upon truſt, nor miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſented
<pb facs="tcp:42069:5"/>the words or ſenſe of the Authors which I make uſe of.</p>
            <p>But I muſt here informe the Reader, that in my Animadverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon <hi>Staffords</hi> Memoirs I have not meddled with the Life and Actions, the Charge or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of the late Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> the Depoſitions of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes or the Obſervations upon them: For I am not angry with the perſon of any Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, nor do I love to trample upon the Grave of a dead man; beſides, it doth not become me to go out of my own Profeſſion, or diſcuſs ſuch matters as do not concern Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And yet I think I may ſafely ſay, that I have not omitted any thing, which looks like an Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Reformed, or a Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Religion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:42069:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> If this Book ſhould fall into the Hands of any of that Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I confeſs I have not much hope of convincing them, who by the very Principles of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are bound to disbelieve their own Senſes. If any of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants ſhall pleaſe to look into it, I have only this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſhall I ſay or juſtice?) to beg of them, that they would read the two laſt Chapters with the ſame ſincerity and freedom from Paſſion, with which they were written; and then let them judge whether thoſe Conſiderations and Advices are not as neceſſary to their own, as to our Safety.</p>

So far as it falls within the Compaſs of my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
            <p>The former Part of the Book is for the moſt part made up of Allegations in proof of the Plot in general, and Reflections on the Depoſitions; The Proceſs againſt the late Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> in particular, with the Evidence againſt him and his Lordſhips Exceptions, the Obſervations of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of the Tryal and the Papiſts An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers to them; the Conſideration of all which I leave to others.</p>
            <p>But that I may not ſeem to paſs over any thing, which looks like a Proof of the Loyalty and Peaceableneſs of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, or of his Majeſties <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Subjects, I ſhall fairly ſet down all ſuch Paſſages as are material to that purpoſe.</p>

            </p>
            <p>That I may proceed with all poſſible clearneſs in my Anſwer to theſe bold Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions, I ſhall reduce what I have to ſay to two Debates.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Concerning the Piety and Vertue of Roman Catholiques.</item>
               <item>II. Concerning their Principles and Practices in the time of the late Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. I begin with the Piety and Vertue of Roman Catholiques.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42069:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> That the Principles of the Roman Church and Religion do naturally tend to make men wicked and diſloyal, I ſhall prove in the following Diſcourſe. And yet I freely grant, That ſome men of that Communion may have a great and juſt Senſe of their own Honour, and that Duty which they owe to their King and Country: They may be better Men, and better Subjects, than the Principles of their Church and Religion do either in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline or allow them to be.</p>
            <p>This may come to paſs any of theſe three ways.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. When they do not underſtand the Senſe of the Roman Church, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tendency of the Principles of their Religion, for the Confeſſors and Guides of Souls (which have the Faith and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the Laity in their keeping) do not think fit at all times and in all places to inſtruct their Diſciples in ſuch Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</item>
               <item>2. When their natural Tempers and Diſpoſitions are ſtronger than the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Church and Religion. For I do not think the worſt Religion in the World can root out all common Reaſon and natural Conſcience, all good Nature and Humanity, and make all men Bloody and Diſloyal, whom Nature hath made
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42069:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>Kind and Peaceable. Some men have more of the Generoſity of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, than of the Treachery of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt; the very names of Murder and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſtrike a kind of Horror into the minds of men, and natural Conſcience (if it be not bribed or biaſſed by a bad Religion or a vicious Life) will ſtartle at the thoughts of Aſſaſſinations and Rebellions, the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Oaths and Contracts.</item>
               <item>3. When they have not much Zeal for Religion. For if men be cool and indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in that Religion which they profeſs, they may be over-ballanced with the Love of their King and Country.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And yet after all no man knows, juſt how much ignorance, good-nature or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency in Religion, will ſerve to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Fury of a miſguided Zeal.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I come to conſider the Principles and Practices of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques in the time of the late Rebellion.</p>
            <p>And though I would not leſſen the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which ſome perſons of that Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have done to his Majeſty, or Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Bleſſed Memory; yet I muſt ſay there are many things which overthrow all the Pretences of Loyalty to the Crown that are made by the main Body of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques.</p>
            <p>That this is no uncharitable Surmiſe will appear if we look back as far as the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42069:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellion, wherein the <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques of that Kingdom were almoſt univerſally engaged.</p>
            <p>I know the Seditious Practices of ſuch as called themſelves Proteſtants were by ſo much the more inexcuſable, by how much Proteſtant Principles are more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Religion, than theſe of the Papiſts. But the Tumults in <hi>Scotland</hi> were now in a great meaſure ſuppreſſed, and the King had by ſome Acts of Grace, and Additions of Honour to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents of that Kingdom quieted, if not obliged his Enemies, when he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with the news of a deſperate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and barbarous Maſſacre of many thouſand Proteſtants in <hi>Ireland.</hi> And as his Majeſties Affairs were hereby put into a much worſe condition than before, ſo the Parliament in <hi>England</hi> became more unreaſonable in their Demands, more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute in their Anſwers, than otherwiſe they either would or durſt have been. For the King conjures them by all that is or can be dear to them or him, to take into conſideration the caſe of his diſtreſſed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Subjects; but (to uſe his Majeſties own Words:) <hi>The Diſtractions and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies here in</hi> England <hi>made moſt men rather intent to their own Safety, or Deſigns they were driving, than to the Relief of thoſe, who were every day inhumanely butcher'd in</hi> Ireland.<note n="(A)" place="margin">

            <p> And F. <hi>Walſh</hi> in the Dedication of his Hiſtory of the <hi>Iriſh Remonſtrance,</hi> tells us of an Univerſal Rebellion or Inſurrection of all the Catholiques in <hi>Ireland,</hi> a very few excepted, againſt his Majeſties Laws, Authority, and Deputies of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>An.</hi> 1641. Of their Confederacy formed, and a War continued by them for many years after; of two ſeveral Peaces (the firſt 1646. the ſecond 1648.) with his Majeſties Lord Lieutenant in that Interim, ſcandalouſly violated by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing party among them.</p>
            <p>Yea, to that prodigious height did the Inſolence of the rebellious Faction ariſe, that at length they baniſhed his Majeſties Lieutenant, and took the Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>But it may be ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, they have repented of their former Wickedneſs.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Let this Author beſtow as hard names as he pleaſes upon the Contrivers and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors in theſe horrid Villanies; and let that Religion, (if ſo wicked a thing muſt be called Religion) which gave encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to them, go (as it deſerves) for Infidelity and Irreligion. I am ſure there are no greater Enemies to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, than thoſe which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pretend to promote it by ſuch ways as are contrary to the very Nature and Deſign of all true Religion.</p>
            <p>Indeed our Adverſaries of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion lay as bad things to the charge of the Proteſtants, as we can do to their Church and Religion; and as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as we put them in mind of the Fifth of <hi>November,</hi> they are ready to reproach us with the Thirtieth of <hi>January.</hi> And that I may not make any cauſe or perſons look either better or worſe than they are, I ſhall make a faithful repreſentation of the Doctrines and Practiſes of both ſides,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42069:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſo far as they are pertinent to the preſent Debate, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the traiterous Seditions and Outrages in <hi>England</hi> and other Parts of Chriſtendom may be imputed to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, with as much reaſon, as the Inſtances of Popiſh Malice and Bloody<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from former Examples may be to the <hi>Roman</hi> Church and Religion?</p>
            <p>Some years ago was publiſhed a Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Libel under the Title of <hi>Philanax An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicus,</hi> wherein the Author taxes not only ſome Proteſtant Reformers, but the very Reformation it ſelf with Rebellion; char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Engliſh Reformers with Treaſon againſt Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> and (with a <hi>Roman</hi> boldneſs) aſſerts, That the Seditious Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are allow'd by the generality of them that call themſelves Proteſtants. But this Book having had a ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Anſwer by Dr. <hi>Du Moulin,</hi> I will not trouble my ſelf or the Reader with any thing which he hath written in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Proteſtant Religion, and the Reformed Churches and Divines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. But I cannot but take notice of the ignorance or rather the Malice of the Author of the Controverſial Letters, (out of whom the ſubſtance of the preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is taken) who tells us, He doth not know that the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath proceeded ſo far as the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath

And our Author is not afraid or aſhamed to ſay, that ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques are <hi>moſt remarkable</hi> peradventure of all others for firmneſs of Loyalty.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour therefore, with as much brevity as the Subject will allow, to vindicate the Honour of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our own Church and Nation from this unjuſt and malicious Charge.</p>

            <p>As to the Sayings of particular Doctors of the Reformation I cannot, indeed I need not defend them; they are no Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of our Faith, nor do their Writings bear the ſtamp of publick Authority. And ſince none of our Adverſaries have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that any of the Reformed Churches have by any Authentick Act approved of Seditions and treaſonable Principles (as I ſhall prove the <hi>Roman</hi> Church doth) they cannot be imputed to the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion with the ſame reaſon, that we charge them upon the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Let the Papiſts ſay and Proteſt, that their Church never taught any Seditious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, yet I ſhall ſooner truſt my own Senſes, than ſuch men as (by the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their Religion) are under no Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſpeaking Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No Church under Heaven did ever more expreſly declare againſt all Seditious and Diſloyal Practiſes, than the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Reformation was begun and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in a peaceable and legal manner; and our Reformers propoſed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that excellent Rule of our Saviour, <hi>They reſtored to God the things that were
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42069:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Gods, and to the Kings the full exerciſe of their lawful Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are Members of a Church whoſe juſt Glory it is not only to have conſtantly taught the Duty of Subjects to their Princes, but ſuffered for her Loyalty to them. Our Kings and the Church of <hi>England</hi> have always rejoyced and wept together; and none ever forſook the Royal Cauſe in its Diſtreſs, which had not firſt forſaken the Church, or at leaſt loſt all their Zeal and Affection to her.</p>
            <p>In Fine, our late Royal Martyr decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That he died for maintaining the true Proteſtant Religion; he acquitted not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but all the true Sons of the Church from the Guilt of his Blood, ſcarce any one of which (he ſaid) had been a Beginner or an active Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the War. If then by the Proteſtant Religion, our Author mean the Chriſtian Religion as it is profeſſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or in the beſt reformed Churches abroad, his Charge is moſt unjuſt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious; if he mean any thing elſe by it, he might better have called it the Popiſh or Fanatick, than the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
            <p>What a potent Faction of men, (which they may call Proteſtants, as they call themſelves Catholiques) did in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, all men know: But of all men living the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> have the leaſt reaſon to call them Traitors and Rebels, as I
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42069:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſhall ſhew afterwards. But though the King was arraigned in the name of the Commons of <hi>England,</hi> yet it was well obſerved by his Majeſty at his Tryal, That they never asked the Queſtion of the tenth man of the Kingdom, much leſs of the major part of the Nation: They had no conſent of the Houſe of Peers; the Ordinance for trying the King being rejected by the Lords. They were no free or full Houſe of Commons; for that Houſe being freed from the Inſolence of the Army reſolved upon a Treaty with his Majeſty, recalled their Votes of <hi>Non-Addreſſes,</hi> and voted that he ſhould be in Honour, freedom and ſafety. And after the major part of the Houſe had voted the Kings Conceſſions to be a ſufficient ground for Peace, the Army Officers ſeized and committed ſome of the Members as they were coming to the Houſe, accuſed others of inviting the <hi>Scots</hi> the laſt Summer, and required that they might be excluded. Thus (many of the Commons being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out, and others abſenting themſelves) they reſtored the Votes of <hi>Non-Addreſſes,</hi> and voted the drawing up a Charge of Treaſon againſt his Majeſty. This is that Venerable Aſſembly (a mere unparliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Juncto) which in obedience to theſe Maſters, damn'd all former Votes in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the King, and brought him to the Block; againſt the Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Oaths of Allegiance and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42069:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>the Senſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> of the Houſe of Peers, and of the greater part of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
            <p>But if we trace the Footſteps of this Rebellion as far as we can, it will appear that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction had a great Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence both on the firſt Beginnings, and Progreſs of it. What is it that they have more maligned than the Government and Conſtitution of this Church and Kingdom? Or how could the <hi>Roman</hi> Conclave find out a ſafer (if not a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er) way to ruin the Proteſtant Religion, than by breaking in pieces that Church which is the Strength and Beauty, that Kingdom whoſe Soveraign was (under God) the Defender of the Reformation?</p>
            <p>It was the Judgment of Biſhop <hi>Bram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> That the Popes Privy Purſe, and Subtle Councils helped to kindle our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Wars, which ended in the Tragical Murder of the Lords Anointed. The intemperate Heat of the Seditious Spirits in <hi>Scotland</hi> had fermented a great part of the Kingdom; but before they broke out into open Hoſtilities, they made ſecret Applications to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> the great Miniſter of <hi>France,</hi> and Favourite of <hi>Rome,</hi> which made uſe of all his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Policy to embroyl his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Affairs in that Kingdom. This great
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42069:22"/>Stateſman knowing that it was the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> to hold the Ballance even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and that his Majeſty had (in the year 35) hindred the <hi>French</hi> from making themſelves Maſters of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> reſolved to blow the Coals in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe upon the Male-contents, whom he found ſo well prepared for an Inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To this purpoſe he ſends <hi>Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi> to exaſperate the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates againſt the King; appoints one of his Secretaries to reſide among them, to be preſent in their Councils of War, and to direct their Proceedings; and ſome of the Covenanters had free acceſs to <hi>Con,</hi> (the ſame Countryman) whilſt <hi>Chamberlain</hi> was Negotiating for the Cardinal. This is certain, the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> and the Jeſuites (thoſe inveterate Enemies of our Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) could not have thought of a more effectual and eaſie Method to bring us to ruin, than by making us do their Work for them; and the Cardinal, who had formed thoſe vaſt Deſigns of enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French</hi> Monarchy, obſerving (if not raiſing) the Tumults in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, laid hold of the Advantage, which men of ambitious and reſtleſs Spirits had put into his Hands.</p>

            <p>As to the later Inſurrections in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I will only obſervel, That beſides the Information of ſome <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts, being ſent thither to prepare them for a Rebellion, their very Declaration ſhews, they were acted by a Popiſh Spirit; for the Act of <hi>Supremacy</hi> was condemned, and the Kings Authority in Eccleſiaſtical Affairs call'd an <hi>

            <p>Whilſt his Majeſty reſided at <hi>York,</hi> he was acquainted by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> with the Information he had received from Sir <hi>W.

               <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Party exaſperated the King and his Subjects one againſt another; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to incenſe his Majeſty againſt them, as conſpiring againſt his Crown and Government; and them againſt their Soveraign, as aiming at the ſubverſion of their Laws, Liberties and Religion. That they ſtirred up the <hi>Scots</hi> to rebel, hindred all accommodation between the King and them, and endeavoured to bring his Majeſty under a neceſſity of craving the Aſſiſtance of the Papiſts, which he ſhould neither obtain without yielding to their own terms, nor refuſe without the hazard of his life: That for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing of their Ends Cardinal <hi>Barbarino</hi> was engaged, fifty <hi>Scotch</hi> Jeſuites were maintain'd in <hi>London, Cuneus</hi> in quality of the Popes Legate, Chamberlain, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain and Almoner to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> Sir <hi>T.

            <p>To what I have ſaid upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will add theſe two Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: 1. That the grounds on which the War againſt the King was maintain'd, (ſo far as it was maintained under a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Religion) were laid by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Faction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; and the moſt dreadful effects of Fanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, which were the conſequents of it, may be juſtified by their Principles.</p>
            <p>And here I could make it evident, That the ſame Maxims of Political Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the ſame Arguments, and many times the ſame Phraſes and Expreſſions,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42069:26"/>are to be found in the heads of both Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. I know it is diſputed, whether the Ring-leaders of Sedition amongſt us poyſoned the Jeſuites, or the Jeſuites them; but I do not envy the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> the honour of having firſt poyſoned them both with Antimonarchical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. If <hi>Milton</hi> (the great Oracle of one of the Factions) had owned himſelf to be a Papiſt, there had been no reaſon to wonder at the Impiety of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which he either did, or might have learned from the Popes and greateſt Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. It was truly alledged by <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacred and inviolable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Princes was preſerved pure and uncorrupt in the Church, till the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> attempted to ſet up a Kingdom in this World paramount to all Kings and Emperours. But he, with his uſual confidence, acquits the Popes, and charges his Antimonarchical Principles on <hi>Luther, Zuinglius, Calvin, Bucer, Martyr, Paraeus,</hi> and all the Reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.<note n="(D)" place="margin">Pro po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo <hi>Anglicano</hi> defenſio, <hi>p. 33.</hi> Quot ſunt Eccleſiae Reformata praeſtantiſſimi Doctores, tot videi aceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos ſibi adverſarios fore, —frustra id in Papam deonerare at que tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure contendis, quod omnes liberae Nationes, omnis Religio, omnes Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxi ſibi ſumunt, in ſe ſuſcipiunt.</note>

            <p> I might oppoſe to the Authority of <hi>Milton</hi> a very late Author of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, who was well acquainted with the Doctrine of it. A reverend and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Divine of our Church charged this Seditious Principle on the Jeſuites; that Government is ſo originally in the People, that they by their Repreſentatives may call their Soveraign to an Account, and alter the Form of the Government; he returns this Anſwer, That <q>
                  <hi>this Principle (whatſoever truth it may have in ſpeculation) is by no means to be preacht to the People, who are apt enough of themſelves to ſtretch Caſes, and pick Quarrels with their beſt Governours; yet it was taught many Ages before the Jeſuites were ſo much as thought of.</hi>

            <p> This latter part of his Aſſertion I could make good; but becauſe I ſtudy brevity, I ſhall only ſet down the Principal Heads of Antimonarchical Divinity as I find them in the Writings of ſome of the Popes, which lived divers Ages before the riſe of the Jeſuites.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, who lived above a thouſand years ſince. The Story of <hi>Phocas</hi> (one of the greateſt Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains and Rebels in the World) is well known. This man from a Centurion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the Ringleader of a Rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Mauritius,</hi> (his Soveraign Lord) cauſed the Emperors Children, the Heir Apparent to the Crown, divers of the Loyal Nobility, and the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be put to death; and yet he was no ſooner gotten into the Imperial Throne; but Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> writes an Epiſtle to him, wherein he baſely and perfidiouſly courts the Tyrant; congratulates his Succeſs in the ſame words the Angels did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Nativity; bleſſes God, and admires the Divine Providence in exalting him to the Empire. This canting flattering Letter might with a little variation have ſerved for an Addreſs to any late Uſurpers.<note n="(F)" place="margin">S. <hi>Gregorii</hi> Magni Opera Fariſi is <hi>1619. c 11.

               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:42069:27"/> 2. The next is <hi>Zachary,</hi> that (about 900 years ago) depoſed <hi>Childerick</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, and abſolved his Subjects from their Allegiance, not ſo much for his Iniquities, as becauſe he was not fit to Govern. And this is atteſted by divers Authors of good Credit, and by their own Authentick Canon-Law;<note n="(G)" place="margin">Decret. Par. 2. Cauſ. <hi>15</hi> qu. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> However <hi>Milton</hi> pretends there was no need of a Pope, the King by his perfidiouſneſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſcharged the people from their Oath made to him.<note n="(H)" place="margin">Pro pop. Angl. def. c.<hi>4.</hi>
               </note> But <hi>Milton</hi> and others of better credit acknowledge as much as is ſufficient to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; That the Pope declared it was the Peoples right to make and un make their Kings; and that he ſhould be King which was fitteſt to diſcharge that Truſt.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>France</hi> were ſenſible (ſay their Hiſtorians) of the Kings idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unfitneſs to Govern, and of the great Vertue of <hi>Pipin;</hi> and upon <hi>Pipin's</hi> conſulting the Pope what was fit to be done in this caſe, his Determination was, that <hi>He ſhould be King, who was fitteſt to diſcharge the Office of a King;</hi> Whereupon the Nobility and People in a full Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly depoſe <hi>Childerick,</hi> and chooſe <hi>Pepin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the People of <hi>France</hi> (with the Popes Conſent and Advice) took off the Crown from their Kings Head, gave it to one of his own Subjects, and changed the Kingdom from one Family to another.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42069:28"/>
            <p> And what unpardonable Crime was this poor King guilty of? What Acts of cruelty had he committed? Indeed there is no ſuch thing laid to his Charge. Some ſay he was a good and religious King; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that he was a good natur'd and eaſie Prince. His Enemies ſay he was not fit to govern; and this is the principal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which the Canon-Law gives for his being depoſed. It may be he was not ſo wiſe as ſome of his Neighbours; I am ſure he was not ſo Crafty as his Holineſs at <hi>Rome,</hi> or his own Subjects at home.</p>

And how ſpecious ſoever the Deſign of it might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to ſome men of more Zeal than Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet in its very Nature and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, it was of moſt fatal Conſequence to the King and Government; and being proſecuted with Force and Armes againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third and Fourth, it coſt one of them his Life and the other his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>The Principal Inſtrument of the League was <hi>Mathew</hi> a Jeſuite; and the Fathers of that Order would give no Abſolution to the Gentry of <hi>France,</hi> unleſs they would vow and promiſe to band themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Soveraign.

In Fine, the Holy League, and the War of Subjects againſt their Kings in proſecution of it, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 13th. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th. <hi>Gregory</hi> the 14th. <hi>Innocent</hi> the 9th: &amp;c. by the Jeſuites and moſt of the Preachers and Confeſſors of all Orders; who ſoon drew in the main Body of the Papiſts into this Combination againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, a King of their own Religion; but unjuſtly ſuſpected to be Haeretically affected.</p>

            <p> It would be too large a digreſſion to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon a Diſcourſe concerning the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn League and Covenant in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and therefore I will only ſubjoyn the two following Obſervations, as a further Proof of the Loyalty and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Reformed Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is that of his Majeſty in his Excellent <hi>Manifeſto</hi> (or late Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning the late Tumults in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by the King <hi>An.</hi> 1639. <hi>p.</hi> 74.)</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>This Covenant was reſented abroad by Papists with infinite joy, in hopes it might oblige the King and his Succeſſors to hate the Proteſtant Religion for the ſake of thoſe Seditious Zealots; and the Prieſts and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites from</hi> Doway <hi>and other Seminaries, came over in great numbers upon that En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. But by Foreign Proteſtants the Covenant was received with moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſcandal and grief, (as his Majeſties Publick Miniſters abroad gave him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count) for they were afraid it ſhould bring an indelible Scandal upon the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alienate the minds of Princes from it. Thus it became Joy and Triumph to our Enemies, Grief and Scandal to our, Friends:</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:42069:31"/> 2. We are told, That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, and <hi>Scotch</hi> Commiſſioners, ſent a Copy of their Covenant, with a ſolemn Invitation to Seventeen Reformed Churches beyond the Seas; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the unjuſt Calumnies caſt upon his Majeſty, we never heard of any one Reformed Church that concurred with them in promoting it.</p>
            <p>It is now time to come to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Jeſuites;</hi> and though I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find that the Divines and Caſuiſts of other Orders are much more Honeſt and Loyal than they, yet I ſhall confine my ſelf to them, becauſe their Seditious and Treaſonable Doctrines are maintain'd for the advancement of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by a particular influence from the Holy See. This is the richeſt, moſt learned and active of all the Orders of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; they are under the ſtricteſt Vow of Obedience to the Pope; have had more ample Charters and Bulls of Priviledges, than all the other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; they are beſt qualified to dive into the Councils of Princes and Stateſmen, and into the Conſciences and Purſes of the People; they have almoſt devoured the Secular Clergy, worn out the other Orders, and engroſſed the trade of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confeſſions in <hi>England</hi> to their own Faction; and whenſoever there hath been any dangerous Attempt upon our Church
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42069:31"/>or State, they were the principal Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and Agents, the other Clergy is but their Tools and Inſtruments.</p>
            <p>How much they have improved and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined theſe curſed Principles, I cannot inform the Reader without tranſcribing a great part of the Works of <hi>Parſons, Creſwel, Suarez, Bellarmine, Bouchier, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana, Fr. de Verone,</hi> and others; out of almoſt any one of which, I could ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an entire Body of Commonwealth Divinity.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be alledged, that theſe are only the Opinions of private Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which are diſowned by the Body of the Society; for their Books are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſed and approved either by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, or by other Superiours, or by the moſt eminent Divines, authorized and aſſigned by them. And is it not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in moſt of the Licenſes, that there is nothing in them contrary to Faith or good Manners? That they are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for all Caſuiſts and Guides of Souls?</p>
            <p>But that this may appear to be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable imputation, I ſhall ſet down ſome of <hi>Bellarmine</hi>'s Principles, and then refer you to the other Authors, as they are cited in the Margent; by which you may ſee, it is the glory of their Society, to be obliged to a perfect Uniformity in Doctrine.<note n="(M)" place="margin">

Out of them they either did, or might have derived the grounds of the War againſt the King, of erecting an High Court of Juſtice, and of bringing him to the Block. Out of them I could eaſily deduce all the Materials of that Bloody Ordinance, to erect an High Court of Juſtice for the Trial of the King; the Impeachment againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in the name of the Commons of <hi>England;</hi> the Speech of <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of that Mock-court of Juſtice; and <hi>Milton</hi>'s Vindication of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the King.</p>

            <p>And one of his Adverſaries in a Letter to him declares, that <hi>J.

But to all theſe Obſervations I will only add one more; That as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative to the Murder of King <hi>Charles.</hi> the Firſt, a Book was printed <hi>An.</hi> 1648. (licenſed by <hi>G. Mabbot</hi>) bearing this Title, <q>

            </p>
            <p>The Heads upon which theſe Speeches are pretended to be made, and the very Matter and Expreſſions (excepting only ſome few not material Paſſages, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken out of the Book of <hi>Parſons,</hi> (an Engliſh Jeſuit) the great Deſign of which was to baffle the Title of King <hi>James</hi> to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> animate the People

            <p>By all which we ſee that the Popes and Jeſuites (though at a diſtance) contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted very much to the late Bloody Wars in <hi>England</hi> and the diſmal conſequences of them.</p>
            <p>All the difference I can find between the Heads of both Factions is only this; Whether the Power of Depoſing and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42069:37"/>Chaſtiſing Kings belongs to the People or to the Pope? The Fanatique Sectaries allow the People (by their Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives) to reſume the Power into their own hands; whereas ſome of the Popiſh Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques reſerve this Power to the Pope as the Common Father of Chriſtendom. Some I ſay, for the greater part of them inveſt the Commonwealth with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>And ſo much of the firſt Propoſition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, the Pope ſtirr'd up his Subjects (of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) to Rebel, forbad them to take the Oath of Allegiance, and abſolved them from their Obedience.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of his Majeſties Reign the Pope by his Bull ſtrictly forbids the taking the Oath of Allegiance.<note n="(O)" place="margin">

            <p> When the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts ſubmitted to the King, ſubſcribed and ſwore to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Articles agreed upon; the Pope abſolved them from their Oath, took upon himſelf to be their General in the perſon of his Nuntio, aſſumed the exerciſe of the Regal Power, impriſoned thoſe <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, and threatned to take away their Lives, who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the Peace, and deſired to return to their Allegiance to his Majeſty.</p>
            <p>And 'tis obſervable, That ſoon after the moſt Infamous Rump had crowned all their Wickedneſs with the Murder of his Sacred Majeſty, they nulled the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, and ſo made themſelves as <hi>Innocent as the Child unborn.</hi>

            <p>I come now to his Lordſhips Principles of Faith and Loyalty, as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led p. 44.</p>
            <p>But firſt he declares; <q>[<hi>As to the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doctrine of King-killing, if he were of any Church whatſoever, and found that to be its Principle, he would leave it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doubtleſs</hi> (ſaith our Author) <hi>the thing which moſt weighed to my Lords Prejudice,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>was a prepoſſeſt Opinion of wicked Principles ſuppoſed to be held and practiſed by my Lord, as the matter of his Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. It is by many taken for granted, the Papiſts hold it an Article of Faith, that to depoſe and murder Kings, to Maſſacre their Neighbours, and deſtroy their native Country by Fire and Sword (when the intereſt of their Religion requires it) are Acts diſpenſable by the Pope, and meritorious of Heaven. Now what thing ſo wicked, however ſlenderly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, will not eaſily be believed against men ſo principled? My Lord therefore to clear himſelf and his Religion from this heavy and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42069:40"/>(as the Papiſts ſay) injurious Aſperſion, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted and declared in the preſence of God and their Lordſhips, his hatred and deteſtation of ſuch Principles; That he acknowledged the King his lawful Soveraign, and knew no Perſon or Authority on Earth could abſolve him from his Allegiance.</hi>]</p>
            <p>From hence I ſhall take occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the following Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Concerning the Doctrine of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Concerning the Moctrine of King-killing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Concerning the Maſſacring of their Neighbours and deſtroying their Native Country, when the Intereſt of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion requires it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Concerning his Lordſhips acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the King to be his Lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign, and that he knew no Perſon or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority on Earth could abſolve him from his Allegiance.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall fairly repreſent the Doctrines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and then leave all men to judge of the natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin with the Doctrine of Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Kings.</p>
            <p>Where I ſhall prove theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is the Doctrine of all the Approved Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:42069:41"/> 2. That it is the Doctrine of their General Councils, and lawful Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That this Doctrine is taught in the Breviaries and publique Offices of the Church.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is the Doctrine of all the Approved Writers of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>And here (to do our Adverſaries right) I acknowledge, that there are ſome things wherein they agree, and ſome wherein they differ.</p>
            <p>That Soveraign Princes may in ſome caſes be deprived of their Crowns and Dignities, is a Doctrine wherein their Divines are ſo univerſally agreed, that I do not know any Book, publiſhed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Order of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which hath plainly and honeſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
            <p>But they are not agreed, whether by vertue of a direct temporal Power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all (at leaſt Chriſtian) Princes, the Pope may depoſe them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; or whether he hath only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct power, whereby he may depoſe them when it is neceſſary for the good of the Church. The former Doctrine is current at <hi>Rome,</hi> and hath been avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Popes, and their Creatures. The latter is Matter of Faith, as many of their own Writers prove by as good Arguments and Authority, as any man
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:42069:41"/>can produce for Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf.<note n="(A)" place="margin">Of the former <hi>l. ſacr. Caeremon.

                  <p>Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in his Oration to the third Eſtate at <hi>Paris</hi> tells us, That unleſs this Doctrine were approved, it follows that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for many ages hath been the Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt and Synagogue of Satan.</p>
               </note> And to let you ſee that his Majeſties Roman Catholique Subjects are no Honeſter than the reſt of the World, I appeal to two very late Writers of our own Country.</p>
            <p>Some years ſince three Treatiſes were publiſhed under the Title of <hi>The Jeſuites Loyalty:</hi> The Author of the firſt round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts (what the other two ſlily inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate) this Depoſing Doctrine, and proves it by as great Authority, as they can bring for any Article of the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Faith.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:42069:42"/>
            <p> The other is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jeſuite too; and he (without any mincing of the matter) tells us this Doctrine was long ago taught by almoſt all Orders and Profeſſions, Seculars, Regulars,<note n="(B)" place="margin">See D. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling fleets</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſerveral late Treatiſes, in the Preface.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And whether they teach the Popes Power to be direct or indirect 'tis all one; for if Princes may be depoſed in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; if there be no ſtanding Court (Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on that at <hi>Rome</hi>) which is to Judge when it is neceſſary to depoſe them; they had as good tell us in plain terms, that no Prince is to wear his Crown any longer, than the Pope and other Princes, or his own Subjects will give him leave; that the Pope never wants Authority to depoſe a King, but when he wants ſtrength or cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, a fair excuſe or a fit opportunity.<note n="(C)" place="margin">Bellar. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognit. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Pont. c.<hi>8.</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia non ſemper privat Principes dominio; vel qui a vires non habet, vel qui a non judicat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedire.</note> And therefore there is no reaſon, why they ſhould have the reputation of moderate men, that ſeem to reſtrain and qualifie the abuſe of the Popes direct tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral power, or to write againſt it with ſome pomp and vanity; when indeed they do but abuſe the world with a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which ſerves only to veil the impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the former aſſertion, and make Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſecure and inapprehenſive of their danger.</p>
            <pb n="65" facs="tcp:42069:42"/>
            <p> Again, the aſſertors of the Pope's indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Power are not agreed, whether a Prince may forfeit his Crown for miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or unfitneſs to govern, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only for Apoſtacy or Hereſie?</p>
            <p>The Doctrine of depoſing Kings for miſgovernment is approved by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Canon Law of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church.<note n="(D)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>If a Prince become a manifeſt Apoſtate, he falls from all power and dignity, in the Judgment of all their approved Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines and Canoniſts.<note n="(E)" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>That a Prince may be depoſed for He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, is ſo generally received, that thoſe very perſons of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which have written againſt it in other caſes, do except the caſe of Hereſie. And 'tis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable that in their General Council of <hi>Lyons</hi> (wherein <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor was depoſed for Hereſie) his Advocate endeavoured to vindicate him from the guilt of that crime, but neither the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror nor he excepted againſt the power of the Church to depoſe him in the caſe of Hereſie.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is the Doctrine of the General Councils and lawful Repreſentatives of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, as the Reader may find in the Margent.<note n="(F)" place="margin">Conc.

For though it was no time for them to ſpeak their minds, yet ſo true were the Fathers of that Council to their Maſter at <hi>Rome,</hi> as to keep up his claim to a temporal power over Princes.

            </p>
            <p>I know ſome private perſons, and ſome Aſſemblies of Church-men (of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communion) have at ſome times taught the contrary Doctrine; but it concerns them, not me to reconcile their Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations with the Doctrine of their Church. However I will ſay theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have been ſuch as were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by Princes, or in expectation of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Preferments from them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have been cenſured and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Teaching Governing part of the Church, and (as much as in them lay) ſhut out of her Communion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:42069:47"/> 3. Where Princes Excommunicated and depoſed for other real or pretended Crimes have procured any Advocates to plead for them; yet they have either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the caſe of Haereſie, or not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to prove the Unlawfulneſs of depoſing Princes for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The next thing to be conſidered is the Doctrine of King-killing.</p>
            <p>Concerning which the late Lord <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> did indeed declare, That <q>
                  <hi>if he were of any Church whatſoever, and found that to be its Principle, he would leave it.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this Patron of the <hi>Roman</hi> Cauſe did not think fit to acquaint us with that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his Lordſhip, (in the printed Tryal <hi>p.</hi> 53.) <q>
                  <hi>As to the Doctrine of King-Killing, and abſolving Perſons from their Allegiance, I cannot ſay the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>does not hold it, I never heard it did hold it, it may be it does, it may be not, I ſay not one thing or other.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From which words we may learn theſe two things.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. That his Lordſhip knew not that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had any where con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd this wicked Doctrine.</item>
               <item>2. That the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prieſts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors do not plainly and honeſtly difa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow and condemn it, or inſtruct their Proſelites in the Principles of Loyalty.</item>
            </list>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:42069:48"/>
            <p> Indeed the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not in expreſs terms aſſerted the Lawfulneſs of putting Kings to death; but there is ſo little difference between the depoſing and putting Kings to death, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever allows of the one, can be no E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to the other, if he underſtand the Conſequences of his own Doctrine. For when a King is depoſed by any lawful Authority, he is a King no longer. If he take up Arms to recover his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you may fight againſt him with as good a Conſcience as againſt an Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>And will a King be ſo tame, as to lay down his Crown at the Popes or his Peoples Feet? Will he ſuffer himſelf to be ſtript of his Royal Dignity without ſtriking a ſtroke, or ſolliciting the Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of other Princes?</p>
            <p>I would not imitate the uncharitable Spirit of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whilſt I am writing againſt it; nor dare I charge all men with the Conſequences of their own Doctrines; but I am ſure, many of the greateſt Divines and Caſuiſts of that Church have both ſeen and vindicated them, and I do not find that the reſt are able to confute them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>But</hi> (ſaith Cardinal <hi>Perron</hi> in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Orations) <hi>a King depoſed, being once Reformed and become a new Man, may be
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:42069:48"/>reſtored to the lawful uſe and practiſe of his Regality</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And what if he will not reform? what if he be more hardned in diſobedience than <hi>Childerick</hi> was, and prefer his own Honour and Conſcience above the Bull of a Pope, or the Act of a Rebellious Faction in his own Kingdom? truly then he may loſe his Head (as well as his Crown) notwithſtanding any care the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath taken of him. If he take the Field, ſo may his Enemies; it may be they have been before hand with him.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe the poor diſarmed man (a King you cannot call him if he have no right to the Crown) be not able to raiſe Forces, and therefore reſolves to trudge to his Holineſs, and there bare-headed, bare-footed (as we know who did) hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg Abſolution of the Pope: Perhaps he may be in a good Humour; grant him Abſolution upon ſuch terms as he did <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>4th.</hi> that he ſubmit himſelf to the Judgment of an Aſſembly of the States.</p>
            <p>But what if it be now too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme? It may be his Kingdoms are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given away to another; (for the Popes are free enough in giving what is none of their own) or perhaps the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of the Kingdom have turned it into a Commonwealth.</p>
            <pb n="78" facs="tcp:42069:49"/>
            <p> In Fine, Princes depoſed from their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty are liable to ſo many hazards, that they have ſeldom ſurvived their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, unleſs it were in exile or in a Priſon.</p>
            <p>But I muſt paſs over the Jugglings and Equivocations of men of King-killing Principles. Ask them if it be lawful to kill a King? They tell you no; and many of them call God to Witneſs the Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Hearts and Loyalty of thier Practiſes.</p>
            <p>But if a King fall from the Faith, and become an Enemy to Gods Church and People; If he do <hi>(regis perſonam exuere)</hi> turn Tyrant, and abuſe his Power to the hurt of the Church and Commonwealth; If he be depoſed (for his Sins againſt God and man) by the Pope, or the Eſtates of his Kingdom; Then he ceaſes to be a King any longer; he is to be uſed as a publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Enemy; the Tyrant, the man of Blood, the Apoſtate, the Haeretique may be put to death without killing the King. And (to do them Juſtice) I confeſs ſome of them are ſo kind to a King, that they will not allow any private perſon to put him to death; but he that is Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the Pope, or Subordinate Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates is no private perſon in the ſenſe of theſe men.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:42069:49"/>
            <p> This is the Divinity of thoſe Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Divines, which either promoted the helliſh Murder of the late King, or afterwards wrote in Vindication of it: And there are ſcarce any Treaſonable Poſitions or Diſtinctions; Preſidents or Arguments, to be found in their Books or Pamphlets, which are not either expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contain'd, or (at leaſt) to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd in the Works of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctors. They are not for killing a King! but before they put him to death they will be ſure to Un-King him; and he ſhall ſuffer not as a King, but as a Malefactor. They will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Authority of a King; but if he betray the Truſt repoſed in him, the wicked Perſon placed in Authority, may be puniſhed not as a King, but as a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
            <p>To look for an expreſs determination of this Point in the General Councils of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, is to ſeek it where there can be no reaſon to expect it; but the General Councils have taught the World the diſtinction between the Kings Perſon and Authority; and according to their Principles, a lawful Prince doth by his Wickedneſs, or Miſgovernment, fall from his Authority, and ceaſe to be a King.<note n="(B)" place="margin">

            <p>And is there indeed ſuch a Religion to be found in the World, that teaches men to Maſſacre their Neighbours, and deſtroy their native Country with Fire and Sword?

            <p> Indeed the Church could only damn the Souls; the burning the Bodies of Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques belongs to the Civil Power; for if they refuſed to abjure, or were relapſed, they were to be delivered to the Secular Arm, and the Magiſtrates were to burn them in ſome publique place.</p>
            <p>In the Second year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (King of <hi>England</hi>) a Law was made, whereby if any Haeretiques being convict did refuſe to abjure, or after Abjuration did fall into relapſe, they were to be left to the Secular Court according to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Canons; and the Major, Sheriffs or Bayliffs (after the Sentence) were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and cauſe them to be burnt in an high place before the People.

            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to give a clear and ſatisfactory Account of theſe four great Queſtions; and proved my Aſſertions by as good Law as any is in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church at this day.

            <p>LEſt this might ſeem a meerly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted Profeſſion of a deſpairing Man,<note place="margin">p. 44.</note> My Lord endeavoured to prove by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral convincing Teſtimonies, he had ever been Inſtructed and Educated in the ſame Sentiments, as the eſtabliſhed Doctrine of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:42069:59"/> 1. <hi>His firſt Teſtimony was taken from places of Holy Scripture; particularly that of St.</hi> Math. 22.21. Render to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars;</hi> &amp;c <hi>from the plain and clear ſenſe of which, and other Texts of Holy Writ, nothing</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>in this World was able to remove him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That we are bound to render to all Men their dues, and to <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are <hi>Caeſars,</hi> is not diſputed among any ſort of Men that I know. But how ſhall a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick underſtand which are the Rights of <hi>Caeſar;</hi> or by a juſt and equal diſtribution give to God what is Gods, and to the King what is the Kings.</p>
            <p>The Holy Scriptures indeed have told us with all plaineſs and ſincerity, what we are to give to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but the luſts and intereſts of Men have perverted the cleareſt Texts, and made them ſerve their own Pride and Covetouſneſs.</p>
            <p>I believe his Majeſty will hardly ſtand to the determination of the <hi>Rhemiſh</hi> Divines, by whom his Lordſhip, ſaith he, was inſtructed in the Principles of Faith and Loyalty. For our Bleſſed Savior commands us, to <hi>render unto</hi> Caeſar <hi>the things that are</hi> Caeſars; and his own practice was a Comment on his Precept.</p>
            <pb n="99" facs="tcp:42069:59"/>
            <p> But the <hi>Rhemiſts</hi> in their Annotations outhat Text, are afraid to ſpeak plain, as Men that mean honeſtly ſhould do. They are more afraid of giving too much, than too little to <hi>Caeſar</hi>

            </p>
            <p>In their Annotations on St. <hi>Math.</hi> 17. they roundly tell us, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath no right to any payments from the Clergy.<note n="(B)" place="margin">

<p>And in <hi>Hebrews</hi> 5.1. in all Matters touching God, his Service and Rellgion, the Prieſt hath only Charge and Authority; as the Prieſt Temporal is the Peoples Governour, Guide and Sovereign, in the things touching their worldly Affairs.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And one of the Holy General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, tells us, (and pretends to prove it from Scripture too) that Secular Princes ought not to require any Tribute from the Clergy.<note n="(C)" place="margin">Conc. <hi>Lat.</hi> 3. c. 19. p. 455, 456. <hi>Ne Laici imponant Eccleſiis onera.</hi> And in the Margent we have <hi>Gen.</hi> 47. quoted.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His ſecond Testimony was taken from the Authority of the General Council of</hi> Conſtance, (<hi>to which all</hi> Roman <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are bound to ſubmit) the</hi> 15th <hi>Canon and definition of which Council is,</hi> Quili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet Tyrannus poteſt, &amp; debet licitè, &amp; meritorie, occidi, &amp;c. <hi>Every Tyrant law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

(Which Clauſe is added in regard of the right of Supream Temporal Monarchs over Inferiour Princes ſubordinate to them.) This Doctrine the Synod declares to be erronious in Faith and Manners, and the ſame as Heretical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Council condemned this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition! And would not an Aſſembly of the old Heathen Philoſophers have done as much? Had the ſame Propoſition been brought before them, and upon the ſame occaſion, I am confident (as far as we can judge by their Writings) they would have made a better proviſion for the ſecurity of Princes, than the Fathers at <hi>Conſtance</hi> did.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is acknowledged, <hi>That all</hi> Roman <hi>Catholicks are bound to ſubmit to this Council of</hi> Conſtance, I will fairly repreſent ſome of the Doctrines of it.</p>
            <p>That damnable Doctrine of breaking Faith with Hereticks was notoriouſly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronized and put in practice by this Council: For the Emperour had granted
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:42069:60"/>a ſafe Conduct to <hi>J. Huſſe;</hi> and yet after he had been ſome weeks at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> the poor Man is (contrary to his ſafe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct) caſt into Priſon. This being done in the Emperours abſence, he comes to the Council, argues the caſe with them; upon which they paſs that In famous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree contained in the 19th Seſſion; from which it is plain, that in the caſe of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, no Prince is bound to keep Faith with any perſons whatſoever. And this Act of the Council ſo fully ſatisfied the Emperours Conſcience, that he looked on himſelf as diſcharged from his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not only concurred in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Priſoner, but gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for his Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>J.</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> was trepann'd by a ſafe Conduct granted by that Council; and being unacquainted with their Arts and Treachery, ventures to <hi>Conftance,</hi> where underſtanding the Jugglings of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, he thought to ſhift for himſelf by flight, but being taken was burnt to death.</p>
            <p>Again, The Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates and deprives of all Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar honour and dignity, all that ſhould preſume to hinder <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> from meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> whether they be Kings, Dukes, Princes, &amp;c. as all men know, which have been converſant in the Acts of that Council.</p>
            <pb n="102" facs="tcp:42069:61"/>
            <p> But I come to the Decree produced by his Lordſhip; a Decree which ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of theſe Kingdoms know how to make their advantage of; when others of greater Authority and Eminency in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church (that dare ſpeak their minds) freely acquaint us with the true Catholick meaning of it.</p>

            <p>In Anſwer to all which I have many things to ſay, but that I may not exceed my intended brevity, I ſhall reduce them to the following Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That this Book of <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed and approved by perſons of greater Authority in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> than the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42069:64"/>Divines of <hi>Sorbon.</hi>
               <note n="(N)" place="margin">Alegambe <hi>Bibl. ſcript. ſoc. Jeſ.</hi> in the life of <hi>Sanctarellus</hi> gives us this Character of him, <hi>Vir mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus apprimé re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligioſis &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destiſſima man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetudine.</hi>
                  <p>The Title of the Book is <hi>A.</hi> Sanctarelli <hi>ſoc. Jeſ. Tract. de Haereſ. &amp;c. Ed.</hi> Romae. 1625. In the Licenſe of the Maſter of the Sacred-Palace are theſe words; <hi>In eo omnia religioni conſona atque utilia adinvenerim.</hi> In another of the Licenſes, <hi>In quo nihil reperi, quod Sanctae Fidei, aut bonis moribus adverſetur.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> It was printed at <hi>Rome permiſſu Superiorum,</hi> approved by three Divines of the Society, licenſed by the General of the Order, by the Maſter of the Sacred Palace, and ſeveral other Divines. By which we ſee what kind of Divinity was then in requeſt at <hi>Rome.</hi> But it may be the Divines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church have <hi>one Conſcience at</hi> Rome <hi>and another at</hi> Paris, as was once ſaid of the Jeſuites.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the breaking out of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot in <hi>England,</hi> when ſo many of that Religion were in danger of their Lives; the Pope thought fit to condemn 65 Propoſitions (as I ſhewed before) but did not ſpeak one word againſt the Power of depoſing Princes, though it was aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame Divines and Caſuiſts with the 65 Propoſitions. And whether the Judgment of his Holineſs, or of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of <hi>Sorbon</hi> be of greater value with <hi>Roman</hi> Catholiques, let all men judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why do the Church and Court of <hi>Rome</hi> ſuffer an hundred as bad Books as this of <hi>Sanctarellus,</hi> (in which the ſame or worſe Propoſitions are maintained) to paſs not only without Cenſure, but with
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42069:65"/>publique Anthority and Approbation?</p>
            <p n="4">4. There are no Propoſitions in the places cenſured by the <hi>Sorboniſts,</hi> which he might not juſtifie by the Principles of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> the moſt correct Editions of the Canon Law; and in the Sentence of Excommunication and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor (with the Approbation of a General Council) the Pope expounds the words of Chriſt (as <hi>Sancturellus</hi> ſince did) not only of the Spiritual, but of the Temporal Power alſo.<note n="(O)" place="margin">In the General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Lyons</hi> (<hi>Concil.tom.</hi> 28. <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>) Innocent the 4th. with the conſent of the Council denounces Sentence of Deprivation againſt <hi>Frederick</hi> the Emperor. <hi>Nobiſque in</hi> B.

            <p>A Speech of ſo much aſſurance, that were it not for diſ-believing my own Senſes, I might be apt to give credit to it.

Or that Tranſubſtantiation and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind were ever taught in any of them? Or that theſe words, <hi>Hoc eſt Corpus meum</hi> are in their Bibles?</p>
            <p>If mens Senſes are not to be truſted in plain ſenſible Matters, he will hardly prove any of theſe things; but if they are, then it is evident that ſuch Principles are aſſerted in ſome of their General Councils.</p>

            <p>[P. 48, &amp;c. <hi>General Councils (which are the Church of God Repreſentative) have no Commiſſion from Christ to frame new mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, but only to explain and aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain unto us, what anciently was, and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and retained, as of Faith in the Church, upon ariſing Debates and Controverſies about them. The definitions of which General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in matters of Faith only, and propoſed as ſuch, oblige, under pain of Hereſie, all the Faithful to a ſubmiſſion of Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[<hi>It is no Article of Faith to believe that General Councils cannot err, either in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact or Diſcipline, &amp;c. Hence it is deduced, If a General Council (much leſs a Papal Conſiſtory) ſhould undertake to depoſe a King, and abſolve his Subjects from their Allegiance; no Catholique, as Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick is bound to ſubmit to ſuch a Decree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hence alſo it followeth; The Subjects of the King of</hi> England <hi>lawfully may, without the least breach of any Catholick Principle, renounce even upon Oath the Doctrine of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Kings Excommunicate for Hereſie, &amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>
               <hi>General Councils are the Church of God Repreſentative!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hath the Church of God (diffuſive) intruſted them with a Power of conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in ſome things and not in others; or of obliging particular perſons ſo far
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42069:70"/>and no further? Where hath the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> warranted any ſuch diſtinction (as this Author makes) between matters of Faith and Practiſe; or confined the whole Power of General Councils to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith only? Laſtly, ſuppoſe there were (as indeed there is not) ſome ground for ſuch a diſtinction; yet why muſt Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation be a matter of Faith; and the depoſing of Princes be none, when both came out of the ſame Forge, the General Council of <hi>Lateran?</hi> How doth it appear that the Council did not propoſe this as matter of Faith, as well as the other?</p>
            <p>But I will appeal to the General Council of <hi>Conſtance;</hi> both becauſe the Author of the Controverſial Letters, urges a Decree of that Council to prove, That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> teaches the Duty to Princes to be a direct point of Faith;<note n="(B)" place="margin">

            <p n="1">1. <hi>That if a General Council (or a Papal Conſiſtory by Authority derived from a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Council) ſhould depoſe a King, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve his Subjects from their Allegiance, all</hi> Roman <hi>Catholiques as ſuch are bound to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuch a Decree.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I confeſs there is a <hi>Roman</hi> Catholique Principle (of Aequivocation and Mental Reſervation) by the benefit of which they may renounce the depoſing of Kings, but ſo they may the receiving the Sacrament in one kind alſo.</p>
            <p>P. 49. <hi>Nor do Catholiques as Catholiques beleive, that the Pope hath any direct or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct Authority over the Temporal Power and Juriſdiction of Princes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This he aſſerts with his uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, gives <hi>Bellarmine</hi> the lie, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces all the Arguments and Authorities of the Cardinal and others, without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at the leaſt proof of his Poſition.</p>
            <p>[<hi>It is an Article of Catholick Faith, that no Power on Earth can licenſe men to lie, to forſwear and perjure themſelves, &amp;c. on pretence of promoting the Catholick Cauſe or Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let him prove, (if he will prove any thing to the purpoſe) That it is an Article of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:42069:72"/>
            <p> Either that there are no Venial Sins; (ſuch as do not put a man out of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, and hazard his Salvation.)</p>
            <p>Or that an Officious Lie is a Mortal Sin, in their account.</p>
            <p>Or that that which otherwiſe would be a Lie or Perjury, may not in ſome caſes, be excuſed by a Mental Reſervation or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[The Doctrine of Equivocation, however wrong fully impoſed on the Catholick Religion, is neither taught nor approved by the Church, as any part of her Belief.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this be not a part of the Practical Divinity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, either ſhe hath none at all, or elſe hath not let the World know where to find it. Indeed it is not taught in their General Councils; for they do not uſe to deſcend to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Rules of Conſcience and Practiſe; but it is taught by the generality of thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines whom the Church hath entruſted with the Souls of men.</p>
            <p>Are either the Books cenſured, or the Authors puniſhed? Are not the Books publiſhed with Approbation, and thoſe Authors moſt countenanced which main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this Doctrine? Hath the Church gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any Caution, or made any Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt it? And if after all this the Church doth not approve of it, what muſt become of the Souls of the people?
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:42069:72"/>May not the moſt erroneous and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines and Practiſes prevail in the Church, whilſt the greateſt part of it follow their Guides, and think they are bound to believe as the Church believes?</p>
            <p>I know 'tis commonly call'd the Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Art of Equivocation; but though they have extended the Practiſe of it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though they have poliſhed it with more dexterity, and defended it with more ſubtilty than others of that Communion; yet I muſt needs ſay, <hi>Parſons</hi> ſpoke one great Truth, when he told us this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine hath been received in the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for 400 years.</p>
            <p>The Principal Caſes wherein the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church allow of it, are theſe that follow.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>If a man be charged with a ſecret Crime, which cannot be proved by clear evidence; If the Judges before whom he appears be Incompetent; (as all ours in</hi> England <hi>are) If it were told him in Confeſſion, or if he hath been abſolved by a Prieſt; If it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the obtaining ſome great good, or the avoiding ſome great evil.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>And what a man may ſafely ſay, he may ſafely ſwear: What he may deny in a Court of Judicature, he may deny at his Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; For if that which otherwiſe would be a Lie, is ſaved by a mental Reſervation, there can be no danger in ſwearing to it; in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our own vindication, and making
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42069:73"/>the moſt ſerious Appeals to Heaven at the point of death.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, ſuppoſe it were unlawful to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocate in any caſe whatſoever; yet if it be not a Mortal Sin; if a thouſand Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial Sins cannot damn a man; I know no reaſon why they ſhould not venture upon it to ſave their own Lives, or the Honour of their Religion.</p>
            <p>In fine; This Doctrine hath been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly avowed by the Holy See; thoſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines which declaim againſt it with moſt ſeeming bitterneſs in other caſes, allow of it in that of Confeſſions; thoſe few Divines which have written againſt it, are charged with ſingularity or haereſie. But he that deſires to ſee the Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocation and Mental Reſervation ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by the greateſt Authorities of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, may conſult any of the Authors cited in the Margent;<note n="(F)" place="margin">Leſſius <hi>de Antichristo in Opuſe.

            <p> And now it were eaſie to give an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Decree made at <hi>Rome (March</hi> 2. 1679.) againſt ſome Propoſitions of the Jeſuites and other Caſuiſts; that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree being ſo very lame and defective, that we are not at all ſecured by it from the pernicious effects of this Doctrine; for</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Propoſitions condemned are the <hi>27th</hi> and <hi>22th.</hi> and though I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thoſe two Propoſitions to be falſe, yet I might equivocate in ſome of the Principal Caſes before mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are not condemned as evil or impious in themſelves; contrary to the Laws of God and Nature; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Cenſure or Condemnation is not indiſpenſable.</p>
            <p>But what if a man be barr'd the uſe of Equivocation and Mental Reſervation? What if he voluntarily, or by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Judges do renounce them?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, If they be lawful in other caſes, there can be no reaſon why they ſhould be ſinful in this.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42069:74"/>i.e. <hi>So as I am bound to tell you.</hi> This ſecond Anſwer is defenſible upon the ſame Principles with the firſt. So <hi>Garnette</hi> was required by the Lords Commiſſioners, to anſwer without Equivocation; yet he denied a certain Truth upon his Salvation, and with the moſt bitter and ſolemn Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations:<note n="(G)" place="margin">Iſ.

            </p>
            <p>[<hi>On the contrary, Simplicity and Godly Sincerity are conſtantly recommended by her (the</hi> Roman <hi>Church) as truly Chriſtian Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, neceſſary to the conſervation of Juſtice, Truth and Common Society.</hi>]</p>
            <p>But doth this Author think we never read the Acts of their Famous Council of Conſtance? I am ſure <hi>J.

            <p>Having thus examined the Principles of this little Treatiſe ſo far as they fall under our preſent Debate, it will be no hard matter to diſcover the Fraud and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie of his Diſcourſe <hi>p.</hi> 47. which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a diſtinct Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The queſtion between us is, Whether the <hi>denial of the Principles</hi> (charged on the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks) be a <hi>ſufficient Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Innocence?</hi>
            </p>

            <p> This Author ſeems to joyn with us in a juſt abhorrence of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[Let thoſe in Gods Name, if any there be, of what Religion ſoever, who hold ſuch Tenents, ſuffer for them; why ſhould the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent be involved with the Guilty? There is neither Reaſon nor Juſtice in it.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs the Deſign of dividing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and making a difference between men of loyal and diſloyal Principles is very charitable; even great and good men are apt to believe that to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, which they earneſtly deſire, and I know none which would not be glad to ſee a prudent and ſafe way found out, for making a diſcrimination between the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and the Guilty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Diſpute among thoſe of out Church is not whether there be any Loyal and Honeſt men of the <hi>Roman</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor yet whether they deſerve more Favour than other Papiſts; but whether we can find out a ſafe and certain way to diſtinguiſh between men of Honeſt and Seditious Principles?</p>
            <p>It is agreed on both ſides;
<list>
                  <item>1. That there are ſome good men of that Communion.</item>
                  <item>2. That the Righteous ought not to be as the Wicked.</item>
                  <item>3. That we can have no ſecurity from
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42069:75"/>the Principles of their Religion.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe very perſons who are for divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Papiſts acknowledge, That <q>
                  <hi>none of them can be truly good and loyal, but ſuch in whom common reaſon or common Chriſtianity prevail above their Religion; that all the Reaſon we can have to believe that they will do us no hurt, if they are truly conſcientious perſons, is only this; That we may hope they do not yet know their Churches Senſe in this matter; at preſent they do not know the repugnancy between their Duty to Princes, and the Principles of their Communion.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſo, how we ſhall diſcover whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe men think themſelves more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to their Duty to their King and Country, than to the Judgment and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Church, I am yet to learn.</p>
            <p>But I cannot (without too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion) enter upon this Debate, which would afford matter enough for an entire Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And yet I cannot paſs by a very plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretence, which ſome <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of late have very much inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to vindicate themſelves and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Publiſher of his Lordſhips Speech refers us to the Dedication of <hi>Peter Walſh</hi> his Hiſtory for a Proof of the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of this Diſtinction. And if this Diſtinction be juſt and reaſonable, (as they ſay it is) then it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that a man may be a true Son of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church; that he may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and act according to the Principles of that Religion, and yet abhor the Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> of its Adherents and Flatterers. I am there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged to examine the Grounds of this Diſtinction, becauſe it is inconſiſtent with the Principles laid down in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Treatiſe: For though I do not involve every perſon of the Romiſh Religion in the guilt of thoſe horrid Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and practiſes; yet I charge them on the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and all ſuch as both underſtand and act in conformity to her Principles.</p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:42069:76"/>
            <p> I have peruſed and conſidered the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of F. <hi>Walſh</hi> his Book; and yet I cannot ſee, that we are beholden to that Church for the Goodneſs and Loyalty of any <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, but either to their Lukewarmneſs in Religion, or to their Ignorance of the natural Tendency of its Principles; either to the prevalence of common Reaſon and Chriſtianity, or of their natural Diſpoſitions above their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Nor can I underſtand what they mean by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> diſtinct from the Court, where this Church is to be found: What Judge of Controverſies ſhe hath eſtabliſhed, what Judicatory ſhe hath erected, to which an Appeal may be made from the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> or how they can maintain an external Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Church, if they lye under the Cenſures of the Court of <hi>Rome?</hi> I ſpeak of ſuch times, when no General Council is to be had, and (according to the preſent conſtitution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church) we are not like to ſee another ſo long as the World endures. But waving theſe difficulties, I ſhall endeavour to make the whole Matter obvious to a common Underſtanding. Let us therefore put that very Caſe which we find in the Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of F. <hi>Walſh</hi> his Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>In this Oath (among other things) they ſwear to defend the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Papacy, and the Regalities of St. <hi>Peter;</hi> to obſerve with all their might the Rules of the Holy Fathers, the Apoſtolical Decrees and Commands; (by which are undoubtedly meant the Popes Canons and Commands.)</p>
               </note> They are bound by this Oath, to obſerve (at leaſt) all the Canons that are already ſet forth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned; and are not many of thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons deſtructive of the Rights of Princes?

            <p>I ſhould be afraid of helping to break in pieces the eſtabliſhed Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; leſt when they have gotten the Power into their Hands, they ſhould betake themſelves to their old Arguments of Fire and Fagot.</p>
            <p>But to return, I ſhall take occaſion from his Lordſhips Declaration, to give a brief Account of the Comprehenſion for Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants, and the Toleration for the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, ſo far as they of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Party are concerned in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I begin <hi>with the Comprehenſion for Diſſenting Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If by Comprehenſion be meant ſuch a Settlement, as tendeth to a firm and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Union of Proteſtants; and is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Security of the Reformed Religion, the Honour of our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and the eſtabliſhment of the Church
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42069:83"/>of <hi>England;</hi> in ſhort, ſuch a Settlement as may ſhew that the preſent Terms of Communion with our Church are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; I ſay, if this be the meaning of Comprehenſion, let it be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Private Perſons (of how great Eminency ſoever) can only make Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals to their Lawful Superiors, for the Laws are ſtill in force, and cannot be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by any Authority leſs than that by which they were Enacted.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That divers very Eminent Perſons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have made the moſt fair and equal Propoſals for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of all wiſe and peaceable men, which are conſiſtent with the Honour and Safety of the beſt eſtabliſhed Church in Chriſtendom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since the Alteration of the Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laws (concerning the Preſervation of our Church and Religion) is one of the weightieſt Conſiderations in the World; ſince it is impoſſible to gain all Parties without receding too far from the firſt Principles of the Reformation; there is ſomething to be done by the Diſſenters before they can reaſonably hope for an Alteration of the preſent Conſtitutions. I mean, it ſhould be known what kind of Alteration is deſired, and for whom, what
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42069:84"/>ſort of men will be gained by it, and what number of them?</p>
            <p>When they which make ſuch loud out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries and paſſionate Expoſtulations for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> have gone thus far; then may our Governours underſtand what Meaſures are fitteſt to be taken; <hi>i. e.</hi> Whether it be expedient to make any Alterations; and if it be, how far to Alter for the ſake of Peace and a firm <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Proteſtants?</hi> Private Perſons may judge of the Lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of things impoſed by Authority; but it is an Argument of Pride and Immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty for private perſons to think themſelves Competent Judges of the neceſſity or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of Laws.</p>
            <p>But this is not the Deſign of the leading Faction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I grant they may be for promoting a ſeeming Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among Proteſtants, (call it by what name you pleaſe) but it muſt be ſuch a one as will only ſerve a preſent turn, and is inconſiſtent with a laſting Settlement; ſuch a one as tendeth not to the leſſening but the encreaſing our Differences, and will in the concluſion ruin the beauty if not the very being of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

The firſt Advice is, To make the Obſtruction of Settlement the great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, eſpecially upon the Fundamental Conſtitution of the Kingdom.
<p>The Letter is cited by the Dean of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> in his Preface to the Unreaſonableneſs of Separation.</p>
               </note> A Church, againſt which as their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42069:84"/>have been more frequent, ſo they have been carried on with more Art and Induſtry, than againſt any Church in the Chriſtian World. A Church that is free from Impoſtures and Innovations, from Superſtition and Enthuſiaſm, which are the principal Ingredients of Popery. A Church that endeavours to reduce all things to their Antient Limits; and ſo long there can be no room for Papal U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations. And I appeal to all wiſe men, Whether it be either the Intereſt or Duty of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faction, (continuing true to their Principles) to ſtrengthen or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair ſuch a Church as this, which they are bound to pull down or break in pieces? All the Service that I could ever find they did the Church of <hi>England</hi> was to raiſe and ſupport Sects and Factions amongſt us, to creep in among them under various diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes; to weaken the Government, to lay us open to the Aſſaults of Foreign and Domeſtick Enemies, and to bring us into ſuch a diſorder and confuſion as was more likely to end in Atheiſm or Popery, than in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Proteſtants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we look back as far as the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Separation from our Church, we ſhall ſee many ſtrong probabilities, that the buſie Factors for Popery (the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites and Jeſuited Papiſts) had a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on it; and what advantages they have ever ſince made of our unnatural Heats and growing Schiſms, we are not
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42069:85"/>wholly ignorant. They knew the ſafeſt (though not the quickeſt) way to reduce their Religion, was by fomenting dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Factions; And when ſome of the Exiles (in the beginning of Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> Reign) returned home with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of ſome things in our Church, they laid hold of this Opportunity of dividing the Proteſtants, and enflamed the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in hope of making them deſtroy one another and fall a Prey to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Adverſary. <q>
                  <hi>Whileſt</hi> Harding, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, <hi>and others (of the</hi> Roman <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion) attacked our Church on one ſide;</hi> (ſaith a learned and faithful Hiſtorian) Coleman, Butten, Hallingham <hi>and others were as buſie on the other.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And it hath been lately publiſhed to the world, (from the Lord <hi>Burleighs</hi> Papers) that <hi>Faithful Commin</hi> a <hi>Dominican</hi> Friar, and <hi>Thomas Heath</hi> (a Jeſuite) were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the Pope and Jeſuites under the diſguiſe of zealous Proteſtants to draw men off from the Communion of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> Such wonderful Friends are the Emiſſaries of <hi>Rome</hi> to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and unite amongſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants!</p>
            <p>But I will conclude this Head with the <hi>Declaration of Indulgence An.</hi> 1671/2; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the Author of the <hi>Letter from a Perſon of Quality to his Friend in the Country</hi> tells us, That <q>

            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Coleman</hi> own'd that the <q>
                  <hi>Fatal Revocation of this Declaration for Liberty of Conſcience was that to which the Papiſts owed all their late Miſeries and Hazards.</hi>
               </q> We all know that from this time Licenſes were accepted, and Meeting-houſes built; People were withdrawn from the Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial Aſſemblies, and Books written to juſtifie their Practiſes upon ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as naturally lead to endleſs Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the deſtroying the very being of our Church: Whole Herds of Prieſts and Jeſuites have lurked in theſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath had a moſt plentiful Harveſt amongſt us.

            <p>It is well known how that reſtleſs Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction fed their Diſciples with continual expectations of a Change, and though theſe two Excellent and Pious Princes did inviolably maintain the eſtabliſhed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, yet they gained this mighty Advantage, that notwithſtanding all the Writings and Speeches, Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Proteſtations of King <hi>James</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery, the Fears and Jealouſies of his Subjects (occaſioned only by ſome ſhort Relaxations) were never cured in his days. And in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, whatever Indulgence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Gentleneſs of his own Diſpoſition prompted him to, or the neceſſity of his Affairs extorted from him, was looked upon as the Effect of his Majeſties Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to Popery. For though the War was raiſed by diſcontented, covetous, and ambitious men, and carried on by a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Faction, yet it was neceſſary to make Religion a Stalking Horſe to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; and the Imputation of Popery was the great Engine, by which they rendred the King and his Adherents odious, and robb'd him of the Hearts of his People; for by this Suggeſtion they abuſed the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of many well-meaning (but intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate) Zealots; perſuaded them to engage in the Defence of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant

            <p>How miſerably then are thoſe poor men impoſed upon, that think the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (at leaſt of the Active Men) of this Faction was meerly to enjoy the Freedom of their Conſciences, or the private Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of their Religion? It is not the Eaſe of their own Conſciences, but a Power to lay inſupportable Burthens on other mens Conſciences which they aim at. What they call Indulgence and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration is indeed Rule and Dominion; they firſt ſtrengthen their own party, and weaken the Eſtabliſhed Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by all the Arts of Fraud and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42069:88"/>Treachery; and when they have once gotten the Power into their Hands, they deprive all others of the Enjoyment of their Religion and Conſciences; and this is notorious in all places where they have had Strength and Opportunity to compaſs their Deſigns.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome good-natur'd People are willing to believe, that they are a very harmleſs and peaceable ſort of Creatures; and others (that pretend to ſome kind of Inſight into Myſteries of State) look upon an Indulgence as the beſt way to oblige and make them ſure to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>How many did I honour with Knighthood</hi> (they are his Majeſties own Words) <hi>of known and open Recuſants? How indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently did I give Audience and Acceſs to both ſides, beſtowing equally all Favours and Honours on both Profeſſions? How free and continual Acceſs had all Ranks
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:42069:90"/>and Degrees of Papiſts in my Court and Company? How frankly and freely did I free Recuſants of their Ordinary Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?—My General Pardon extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all convicted Prieſts in Priſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they are ſet at liberty as good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and all Prieſts that were taken af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were ſent over and ſet at Liberty there, (after a Proclamation, That all Prieſts that were at Liberty might go out of the Country by ſuch a Day.) But time and Paper will fail me to make Enumeration of all the Benefits and Favours that I beſtowed in general and particular upon Papiſts; in recounting whereof every Scrape of my Pen would ſerve but for a Blot of the Popes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and Injuſtice in meating me with ſo hard a meaſure for the ſame.</hi>

            <p>I know nothing that could exaſperate them under King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, his Majeſties Goodneſs and Clemency to them gave occaſion to a wicked and malicious Imputation, of his being <hi>popiſhly affected,</hi> and what requital they made his Sacred Majeſty I have already ſhew'd.</p>
            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:42069:90"/>
            <p> Since his Majeſties Bleſſed Reſtaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have enjoyed as great a meaſure of Peace and Liberty, as ever any People did under a Prince of a different Religion. As his Majeſty was very tender of their Lives and Fortunes, ſo his Proteſtant Subjects have been ſo far from thirſting after their Blood, that they never gave them any diſturbance which was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their own Safety, till the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Plots and Deſigns againſt the Government awakened the ſleeping Laws. Let us appeal to the Teſtimony of the late Lord <hi>Stafford;</hi> his words (in the printed Tryal <hi>p.</hi> 200.) are, <q>
                  <hi>Since his Majeſties Happy Reſtauration I do conceive, and I think I may ſafely ſay it (for you all know he was Gracious and Good to all Diſſenters, particularly to them of the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Church) they had Connivence and Indulgence in their Private Houſes, and I declare to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, I did then ſay to ſome that were too open in their Worſhip, that they did play foul in taking more liberty upon them than was fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for them too, and that brought the Misfortune upon me which I will not name.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And now a man might wonder at the continual and loud Complaints of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for their Religion and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; and their Reſtleſs Endeavours to procure Liberty of Conſcience (as they call it) by any Means, at any Price. If ever they wanted Liberty ſince the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42069:91"/>Reformation, they may thank themſelves for it: They have generally enjoyed the Private Exerciſe of their Religion; but this is not the meaning of <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> in the ſtile of our times.</p>
            <p>From theſe Inſtances it is evident, That if Kindneſs and Lenity were the way to oblige the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks of theſe Kingdoms, we had never heard of a <hi>Spaniſh Armada,</hi> a <hi>Gunpowder Treaſon;</hi> of an <hi>Iriſh Rebellion,</hi> or of a <hi>Plot againſt his Sacred Majeſty,</hi> whom God long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; they would have been indeed (what they falſly pretend to be) His Majeſties <hi>Loyal and Dutiful Subjects.</hi> But I wiſh they had not taken an effectual Courſe by the many Conſpiracies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this laſt hundred Years, and by this of equal or greater Horror than the reſt, to convince us how eaſily a Popiſh Zeal can break through all Obligations of Religion and Gratitude.</p>
            <p>I will conclude this Chapter with the Judgment of our late Royal Martyr, concerning theſe men and their Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

               <hi>Some other things propounded to the Diſſenters by way of Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Advice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Concluſion of the whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THus far I have endeavoured to lay open the Myſtery of Iniquity and Rebellion, as it hath been carried on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence of Zeal for God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>I have fairly repreſented thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and Principles which ſtrike at the very root of our Eſtabliſhed Religion and Government; with the Arts and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been uſed by the prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Faction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church for the Subverſion of them. And I know no ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Argument againſt the Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of any Religion, than that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plants Moral Righteouſneſs and ſerves to be a Bond of Conſpiracy; allows of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Treachery, Injuſtice and Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For how can that Religion be from God, which maketh Men unlike to God; as bad or worſe than if they were left to the Principles and Inclinations of their own Natures?</p>
            <p>I have proved, That there are no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Rules of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which enjoyn or countenance any Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or Bloody Practiſes for the Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; and there is no reaſon why
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42069:93"/>thoſe Faults of Ill Men ſhould be imputed to Religion, which proceed either from the Ignorance or the Want of it.</p>
            <p>The True Reformed (<hi>i. e.</hi> Chriſtian) Reiigion is the ſtrongeſt Bond of Humane Society, the beſt Friend in the World to Civil Government; 'tis a better Security to the Throne of a King than all his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and Magazines, all his Guards and Armies: It never licenſed any Treaſons or Murders, any Inſurrections or Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres, though it were for the beſt Ends, for God and Religion; and why ſhould ſuch a Religion ſuffer in our eſteem for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines or Actions of men, which under the diſguiſe of Zeal againſt Popery have weakned the Reformation?</p>
            <p>Of the Church of <hi>England</hi> I will only ſay; It hath eſtabliſhed the Righth of Kings upon ſuch ſure and unalterable Foundations, that it is the Intereſt as well as the Duty of the Civil Power to ſupport and defend it.</p>
            <p>But I cannot diſmiſs this Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering ſome things by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Advice to all ſuch as (out of a juſt regard to the Honour of God, and the Tranquillity of this Church and Kingdom) deſire to prevent the Deſigns of our Enemies, and tranſmit the True Religion to Poſterity. I ſpeak to Men that have ſeen or heard of the Ways and Means, by which the Monarchy and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42069:94"/>Church of <hi>England</hi> were once overthrown; to men that have felt both the Calamities of an Inteſtine War, and the Happineſs of a long Peace; and therefore I need not trouble the Reader or my ſelf with thoſe things which are freſh in our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories.</p>
            <p>We have of late been alarm'd with the Apprehenſions of Popery, and we are loth to put our Necks under that Yoak which our Fathers were not able to bare. But do we deteſt Popery for the ſake of the Church and Kingdom, as well as our own Eſtates and Liberties? Do we hate Popery for the Immorality as well as the Deſtructiveneſs of its Principles? Are we Zealous for the Reformed Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it teaches us to fear God and honour the King; to be juſt and merciful to our Brethren, humble and obedient to our Lawful Governours? If theſe be not the Motives of our preferring the Proteſtant before the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, we better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of <hi>Hobbiſts,</hi> than of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> Proteſtants and no Chriſtians! Proteſtants only becauſe 'tis againſt our Humour or Intereſt to be Papiſts! But if we have indeed a greater regard to our Souls than our Fortunes; if we value the honour and ſecurity of our Religion above our temporal Concernments, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of the Reformation above our private Fancies and Paſſions; then we ſhall be infinitely fearful of giving any Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42069:94"/>to our Enemies of <hi>Rome,</hi> of ſerving the Deſigns of the Papiſts <hi>really and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> (to uſe the words of a late reverend Author) <hi>though not deſignedly and intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Then let us beware of thoſe Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doctrines and Principles which were firſt ſet on foot, and have been ſince kept up by the prevailing Faction of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. What Doctrines were taught by ſome of the Popes before the breaking out of an avowed Deſign for an Univerſal Monarchy, I have ſhewed already. But for the laſt ſix hundred years, all things have been contrived and carried on for the ſetting up a Kingdom in the Church, to which all the Princes of the Earth are to ſubmit. The Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> have uſurped upon the Crowns of Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; (under the pretence of a direct or indirect Supremacy over them) Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and depoſed them for Tyranny and Hereſie; abſolved their Subjects from their Allegiance, and animated them to take up Arms againſt them. The General Councils of that Church have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Treaſon by a Law; their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees are entred into the Body of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law, alledged by their Schoolmen, juſtified by their Divines and Caſuiſts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and improved by the Jeſuites. And 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> tranſplanted thoſe Antimonarchical Doctrines (which he had learnt of one of theſe Maſters) from the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42069:95"/>Church into the State; but with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence only, that he inveſted the People with that Authority over Princes, which the other had placed in the Pope.</p>
            <p>But (to omit many particulars of leſſer moment) theſe are properly Popiſh Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Jeſuitical Tenents, and they have been the main Pillars to ſupport the Papal Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>That the Original of all Civil Power is from the People, and derived from them to the Prince by way of Mutual Compact. That a King is the Peoples Truſtee, and their duty to him only Conditional. That his Perſon and Authority are ſeparable; and that the Cognizance of Eccleſiaſtical Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to him. That the Church hath Power to Excommunicate the King, and (in certain Caſes) to denounce Sentence of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation againſt him; that it is lawful for Subjects to enter into Confederacies and take up Arms againſt him for their Religion and Liberties; and that the Commonwealth may curb and reſtrain him, bring him to Tryal and Condign Puniſhment.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I can hardly meet with any Seditious Antimonarchical Doctrines, or any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Arguments to maintain them, in the Pamphlets of the laſt Forty years, but they are either expreſly contained in the Writings of the Popes and Jeſuites, or at leaſt may be parallell'd in the approved Divines and Canoniſts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Certainly the Enemy hath ſown
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42069:95"/>theſe Tares in the Field;<note n="(A)" place="margin">St. <hi>Math.</hi> 13.28.</note> The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable reſtleſs Enemy of <hi>Rome</hi> hath cunningly ſown theſe Principles of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongſt us, and induſtriouſly fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch Practiſes as are conſonant to them.</p>
            <p>And now let all men which call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Proteſtants conſider, That it was not the leaſt part of the Deſign of our Reformers, to aſſert and retrieve the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights of the Crown; and how can it be for the Honour of the Reformation, to maintain ſuch Doctrines, as naturally tend to the weakning or ſubverting that Authority which they Eſtabliſhed? They have left us a more holy and peaceable Religion than that of the Papiſts; and if we would ſhew our ſelves <hi>true Proteſtants,</hi> our Doctrines and Practiſes muſt proteſt againſt Popery, and prove us better Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and better Subjects than they.</p>
            <p>If you are Proteſtants of the Church of <hi>England</hi> as it is eſtabliſhed amongſt us, I need only put you in mind, that you have been Educated in a Faith of Loyalty and Obedience; and you can never be tempted by any the moſt plauſible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to deſert it, without either forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king or being falſe to that Church where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you are Members.</p>
            <p>If you are Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I know not how it can conſiſt with your Zeal againſt Popery, to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42069:96"/>any thing towards the breaking in pieces that Government, which you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the preſent (as well as former) Deſigns of the Papiſts are levelled againſt. You glory in the Name of Proteſtants, but where do you find any one Proteſtant Church in the World, that hath by any publick Act aſſerted any of theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines?</p>
            <p>I ſpeak not either to <hi>Hobbiſts</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,</hi> or to furious and wild Fanaticks, but only to men of Conſcience and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſuch as (I believe) have a real (tho miſguided) Zeal for the proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for their King and Country: To ſuch as have not forgotten that a War was raiſed for the Preſervation of Religion and Liberty, but ended in the ruin of them both; That an Army turned their Arms againſt them from whom they received their Commiſſion;<note n="(B)" place="margin">Prinnes <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle before his Speech of</hi> Decemb. <hi>4. 1648.—</hi>

But I will only appeal to the Teſtimonies of two Eminent Perſons of the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Perſuaſion; ſome of whoſe words I have tranſcribed in the Margent <note n="(S)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Gangraena,</hi> by <hi>Th. Edwards</hi> (Ed. 3. 1646.) In the Epiſtle Dedicatory to the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> Aſſembled in Parliament. You have, moſt Noble Senators, done worthily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Papists, Prelates,</hi> and Scandalous Miniſters, in caſting down Images, Altars, Crucifixes, throwing out Ceremonies, &amp;c. but what have you done againſt other kinds of growing Evils, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Schiſm, Diſorder, againſt <hi>Seekers, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Browniſts, Libertines</hi> and other Sects? — You have made a Reformation; but with the Reformation have we not a <hi>Deformation,</hi> and worſe things come in upon us than ever we had before? Were any of thoſe Monſters heard of heretofore, which are now common among us? as denying the Scriptures, pleading for a <hi>Toleration</hi> of all Religions and Worſhips, yea, for Blaſphemy, and denying there is a God. You have put down the Book of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Prayer,</hi> and there are many among us have put down the Scriptures, &amp;c.—You have caſt out the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and their Officers; and we have many that caſt down to the ground all Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in all the Reformed Churches. You have caſt out Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies in the Sacraments, as the <hi>Croſs, kneeling</hi> at the Lords Supper; and we have many caſt out the Sacraments, Baptiſm, and the Lords Supper, &amp;c.—If <hi>Schiſm, Hereſie, &amp;c.</hi> be let alone, and riſe proportionably for one year longer, we ſhall need no Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valiers nor Enemies from without to deſtroy us.
<p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Preface to the Cure of <hi>Church Diviſions.</hi> I have long ſtood by while Churches have been divided and ſubdivided, one Congregation of the Diviſion labouring to make the other contemptible and odious; and this called, <hi>The Preaching of Truth, and the Purer worſhipping of God.</hi> I have ſeen this grow up to the height of <hi>Ranters</hi> in horrid Blaſphemies, and then of <hi>Quakers,</hi> in diſdainful Pride and Surlineſs; and into the way of <hi>Seekers,</hi> that were to ſeek for a Miniſtry, a Church, a Scripture, and conſequently a Chriſt.—I have lived to ſee it put to the queſtion in that which they called the <hi>Little Parliament,</hi> Whether all the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Pariſhes of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be put down at once?</p>

            <p>But we cannot joyn with the Church of <hi>England</hi> (as now Eſtabliſhed) with a ſafe Conſcience! and we ought not to provide for the ſecurity of our Religion by ſinning againſt God.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer. Since you are under Laws and Government;</p>
            <p n="1">1. You may (with a ſafe Conſcience) ſubmit to all ſuch conditions of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, as you do not believe to be ſinful. And either all the Goſpel Precepts of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience ſignifie nothing at all, or they ſignifie thus much, That you ought to come up to Authority, as far as you can without diſobeying the Commands of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may with a ſafe Conſcience make the moſt favourable conſtruction of all doubtful things, which they are fairly capable of.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:42069:104"/> 3. You are not bound in Conſcience to affront the Eſtabliſhed Religion and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You are bound to make Conſcience of one Duty, and one Sin as well as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Are not the Obedience and Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, doing Juſtly, loving Mercy, and walking Humbly with God, matters of Duty? Are not Spiritual Pride and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs, Falſe Accuſations and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings, Schiſm and Sedition, forbidden by the Law of God?</p>
            <p>Could Men be perſwaded thus far (and there is all the reaſon in the World that they ſhould) they would ſeek out for Information, and not take up Objections upon truſt; they would proportion their Zeal to the nature of things, and yield to a reſtraint of their liberty (in all things not ſinful) for the Peace of the Church; the number of Diſſenters would be leſſened, and they would joyn with us in oppoſing the Common Enemy; they would take the moſt effectual courſe to incline their Superiours to pity them, and ſecure the Peace of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences.</p>
            <p>But it is time to draw to a Concluſion of the Whole. Let us not expreſs our Zeal againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> by Swearing and Hectoring againſt it, by Curſing and Drinking to its Confuſion; by Sedition and Faction, by Vices or Immoralities of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:42069:105"/>what kind ſoever; for theſe are the ready ways to bring it in.</p>
            <p>But as the Piety and Zeal of our firſt Reformers baniſhed Popery out of our Confeſſions of Faith and Publick Offices, ſo let us baniſh it out of our Hearts and Lives; and particularly let us ſincerely put in practiſe thoſe Vertues which the Reformed Religion teaches, as oppoſed to Popery; <hi>viz.</hi> Serious Devotion to God, and inflexible Loyalty to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, Chriſtian Meekneſs and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Truth and Fidelity toward all Men.</p>
            <p>Let us firſt make uſe of all lawful Means, (for the Divine Providence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the uſe of all honeſt Means for the prevention of impendent Dangers) and then make our fervent and conſtant Addreſſes to the Throne of Grace for a Bleſſing upon our juſt Endeavours.</p>
            <p>But what good and wholeſom Laws are fit to be made for the ſtrengthning the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Intereſt, and the keeping out of <hi>Popery,</hi> doth not become Perſons of a private Capacity too nicely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
            <p>I am not ſpeaking to Law-Makers, but to ſuch as are tied up to the Laws in being; nor do I think my ſelf able to determine, what further Laws may be made for the ſecuring the Church and Kingdom (againſt all future Machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or promoting a firm
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:42069:105"/>and laſting Union amongſt our ſelves. Theſe Conſiderations are to be left to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>In fine, Let us lay aſide all private Animoſities and ſecular Ends in matters of Religion, and ſtudy the true Celeſtial <hi>Wiſdom, which is firſt pure, then peaceable, mild, and eaſie to be intreated; full of mercy and good works, without partiality, and without hypocriſie.</hi> So ſhall we confute the Calumnies of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Emiſſaries, and adorn the Doctrine of God our Saviour; engage the Divine Providence to take care of us and our Religion, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with the <hi>fruit of Righteouſneſs, which is ſown in peace for them that make peace.</hi>
